# sql-challenge

For this challenge, one of the greatest difficulties was correctly creating the ERD, finding all columns with duplicates and reordering tables based on key equivalencies. I created and tested quite a few ERD's before refreshing myself with the course recordings and fully completing the framework.

However, once that framework was in place, I found creating the data queries was much easier than I had anticipated. To avoid messing with or deleting values from primary keys, I chose to construct views for each step, with some steps being completed with where statements in the final "select *" of each step. After manipulating smaller datasets in Jupyter, the value of SQL for larger relational databases became more apparent.
